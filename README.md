# -Voter-information-scraper
This python project aims to extract voter information from web site (https://electoralsearch.in/) by filling some basic details of voter and captcha code.
Requirements
To run this project you need to have python environment setup on your system
I've attached requirements.txt which contains libraries required to use this script. Run following command for installing libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

You also need appropriate web driver based on your browser that you can download by googling it.
If required you need to change code if using other than chrome browser, in this script I've used chrome driver (version. 70-72).
It is developed with Python 3.7 using selenium and open-ocr api for captcha text extraction, so for captcha correction you might need to run this multiple times.

How to run?
After setting up environment, you just need to type following command in your command prompt/terminal to use this script:

python webscrapper.py

Where to find extracted information?
After running above command you'll get Voter.csv file at your script location which will contain all the information of your voter.

NOTE:
For extracting each voter information, as of now you need to call this script every time and also need to fill required information in code itself! Make sure you are not overwriting your existing voter information, as running second time will replace previous Voter.csv file.
